1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was my client, and they wanted me to design a web-based game called "Draw It or Lose It." The game is based on the TV show "Win Lose or Draw," where teams guess images being drawn. The client required a game that could work across different devices and operating systems, supporting multiple teams with unique identifiers for players, and ensuring that only one instance of the game runs at any time.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I feel that I did a good job clearly documenting the requirements and constraints. I made sure to thoroughly understand what the client needed and reflected that in the design. The cross-platform accessibility and memory management details were well thought out, ensuring that the game would run smoothly across various environments.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document really helped me when it came time to develop the code. By laying out the architecture and constraints beforehand, I had a clear roadmap to follow, which made the actual coding process much smoother. It also helped me anticipate potential issues and address them early in the design phase.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I had to pick one part to revise, I’d focus on the domain model. While it covered the basics, I think I could improve it by providing more detailed relationships between the entities and maybe adding more specific methods or attributes that better represent the game's functionalities. This would make the design even clearer and more robust.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I took the user’s needs seriously and made sure they were front and center in my design. For example, I knew that cross-platform functionality was critical, so I chose a web-based approach that could run on different devices. It’s crucial to consider the user’s needs because the success of the software depends on how well it meets their expectations and solves their problems. If the software doesn’t align with what the user wants, it’s not going to be successful.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My approach to designing this software was to start with a clear understanding of the requirements and constraints, then map out the system architecture before diving into the details. In the future, I’d continue using this method but also incorporate more iterative testing throughout the design phase. This way, I can catch potential issues earlier and ensure the design is solid before moving on to development.
